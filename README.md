# Beyond the sandbox: using app groups to communicate between iOS or macOS apps

**Summary:** Apple's "app group" technology allows a collection of sandboxed macOS or iOS apps from the same development team, developer, vendor, etc., to all communicate with each other, coordinate functionality, share resources, and/or minimize redundancies. As long as all developers involved in creating apps meant to be part of an app group can securely share a Team ID from an Apple Developer portal account, they can write apps that can transcend sandboxing. Member apps of an app group share access to a special group container, a shared folder structure, whose root folder has the same name as the app group ID. In the <a href="">sample app that accompanies this tutorial</a>, several apps share a preference stored in a `.plist` file that lives in the special group container. The preference is the background color to be used by app group apps' `UIView` instances. If one app sets (writes) this shared background color preference to, say, the color green, other app group members read this preference and change their view layer `backgroundColor` property to `NSColor.green.cgColor`. There are two other color choices, red and blue. I've created the beginnings of a group of related apps sharing settings, say, a color scheme -- even if all the apps are sandboxed. ...
